craeted a new angular app
imported materialize css and jquery
created sign up component and shared folder for services then created a user services
I am using a template driven form so I brought in imported FormsModule from angular/form

/* Adding validate class to our from materialize already helps us with the functionality
   of the commented code below. However if we are using bootrap we write the code below to
   achieve the same thing.
*/

/* input.ng-invalid.ng-dirty{
  border-bottom-color : #e91e63 !important;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0 #e91e63 !important;
} */


Next we disable to button sumbit when the form is not valid.
